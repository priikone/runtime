/****h* silcutil/Thread Interface
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Interface for platform independent thread implementation and thread pool
 * system.  The interface provides routines for applications that need
 * concurrent execution with the application's main thread.  The threads
 * created with this interface executes concurrently with the calling thread.
 *
 * The thread pool system can be used to start many threads and execute code
 * in the threads.  The thread pool manages the threads creation and
 * destruction.
 *
 * The interface also provides routines for accessing the Thread-local
 * storage (Tls) on all supported platforms.

 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    This context is the actual SILC Thread and is returned by
 *    the silc_thread_create functions, and given as arguments to
 *    some of the silc_thread_* functions. This context and its
 *    resources are released automatically when the thread exits.

/****f* silcutil/SilcThreadStart
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *
 *    typedef void *(*SilcThreadStart)(void *context);
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    A callback function that is called when the thread is created
 *    by the silc_thread_create function.  This returns the return value
 *    of the thread. If another thread is waiting this thread's
 *    destruction with silc_thread_wait the returned value is passed
 *    to that thread. The thread is destroyed when this function
 *    returns.

/****f* silcutil/silc_thread_create
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *
 *    SilcThread silc_thread_create(SilcThreadStart start_func,
 *                                  void *context, SilcBool waitable);
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    Creates a new thread. The `start_func' with `context' will be
 *    called if the thread was created. This function returns a pointer
 *    to the thread or NULL if the thread could not be created.  All
 *    resources of the returned pointer is freed automatically when the
 *    thread exits.
 *
 *    If the `waitable' is set to TRUE then another thread can wait
 *    this thread's destruction with silc_thread_wait. If it is set to
 *    FALSE the thread is not waitable.
 *
 * NOTES
 *
 *    If the `waitable' is TRUE the thread's resources are not freed
 *    when it exits until another thread has issued silc_thread_wait.
 *    If the `waitable' is TRUE then another thread must always issue
 *    silc_thread_wait to avoid memory leaks.
 *
 *    On Symbian Cleanup Stack is created and new Active Scheduler is
 *    installed automatically for the created thread.  The thread also
 *    shares heap with the calling thread.

 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    Exits the current thread. This can be called to explicitly exit
 *    the thread with `exit_value'. Another way to exit (destroy) the
 *    current thread is to return from the SilcThreadStart function
 *    with exit value. The exit value is passed to another thread if it

/****f* silcutil/silc_thread_wait
 *
 * SYNOPSIS

 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    Waits until the thread indicated by `thread' finishes. This blocks
 *    the execution of the current thread. The thread is finished if it
 *    calls silc_thread_exit or is destroyed naturally. When the thread
 *    exits its exit value is saved to `exit_value' and TRUE is returned.
 *    If the `thread' is not waitable this will return immediately with

 * DESCRIPTION
 *

 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    Run the `run' function with `run_context' in one of the threads in the

 *    and call it once a thread becomes free, if `queueable' is TRUE.  If
 *    `queueable' is FALSE and there are no free threads, this returns FALSE
 *    and `run' is not executed.
 *
 *    If `completion' is non-NULL it will be called to indicate completion
 *    of the `run' function.  If `schedule' is non-NULL the `completion'
 *    will be called through the scheduler in the main thread.  If it is
