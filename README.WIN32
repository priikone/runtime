Compiling SILC Runtime Toolkit on WIN32
=======================================

SILC Runtime works on native WIN32 systems as well.  This document is
intended for those who needs to compile the Toolkit for native WIN32
systems.  The Toolkit can be compiled for native WIN32 systems using
generally any compiler.  However, the compilation environment is designed
to currently work with the MSVC++ (version 6.0) and with the MinGW (under
cygwin).


Compiling SILC Runtime Toolkit with MSVC++
===========================================

The MSVC++ workspace and project files resides in the win32/ subdirectory
of the Toolkit package.  The `silc.dsw' file is the workspace file that
automatically supports compiling the Toolkit and to generate the SILC Core
DLL and SILC Client DLL libraries.

The SILC Core DLL is named as libsilc and will generate libsilc.dll, and
the SILC Client DLL is named as libsilcclient and will generate
libsilcclient.dll.  Both of the projects also automatically generates
libsilc.lib and libsilcclient.lib import libraries that may be used to
link against a client application.

Generally you do not need to do any specific settings to compile the
Toolkit.  However, you must compile the libsilc before compiling the
libsilclient, since the SILC Client DLL depends on the SILC Core DLL.

You may compile the DLLs as either Release or Debug version.  Just select
the preferred method of compilation.  The Debug version will compile the
SILC Toolkit with debugging which you can conditionally use in your client
application by setting the global variable silc_debug to TRUE or FALSE.


Compiling SILC Runtime Toolkit with MinGW
=========================================

Note that this method is not officially supported and may not work at all.

To compile the Toolkit with MinGW you first need to install the cygwin and
the MinGW into your system.  After that you can just normally give the
./configure with the following option:

	./configure --with-win32

If you want to compile debug version give also the --enable-debug option
to the ./configure.  After configuration the source tree is ready for
compilation which you can simply start by giving the command:

	make

Note that some of the subdirectories in the Toolkit will not compile under
WIN32 (namely the silcd/ that includes the SILC Server).  For this reason
it is suggested that you will give the command make in the lib/ directory
to compile the DLLs.  Thus, you should give the following commands after
giving the ./configure.

	cd lib
	make

After compilation there should be silc.dll and silcclient.dll files in
the lib/ directory.  It will also generate silc.lib and silcclient.lib
files for linking against a client application.


Compiling SILC Runtime Toolkit with Cygwin
==========================================

Note that this method is not officially supported and may not work at all.

Compiling the Toolkit with Cygwin is equivalent to compiling with MinGW
except that the ./configure does not take the --with-win32 option.  In this
case it will compile using Cygwin's libraries and the binaries will require
the Cygwin DLL.
