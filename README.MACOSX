Compiling SILC Runtime on MAC OS X
==================================

SILC Runtime works on MAC OS X as well, as that is Unix based operating
system.  Some compilation issues however must be taken into consideration.

To compile the Toolkit on MAC OS X give the following commands:

	setenv CFLAGS -no-cpp-precomp
	./configure powerpc

If you want to compile debug version give also the --enable-debug option
to the ./configure.  After configuration the source tree is ready for
compilation which you can simply start by giving the command:

	make

This will compile the libraries and applications.  If you do not want to
compile the applications, before giving make command go to the lib/
directory, and give make there:

	cd lib
	make

This will compile only the libraries, and nothing else.

To install the compiled Toolkit into your system give the command:

	make install
