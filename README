SILC Runtime Toolkit
====================

SILC Runtime Toolkit (SRT) provides useful utility functions for application
programmers.  The SRT can be used as the sole and main runtime in any
application.  It provides application main loop, hash table, lists, atomic
operations, threads, locks, queues, file descriptor stream, socket stream,
network routines, a finite state machine, memory pool, random number
generator, buffers, regular expressions, and many many other features.

The SRT natively supports multiple platforms; Unix/Linux, Windows, Mac OS 
X and Symbian OS, and all APIs work identically or nearly identically on 
all support platforms.  The SRT and all of its APIs are entirely reentrant 
and some APIs are completely thread safe.

The SRT is free software and is dual-licensed with GNU GPL and BSD
licenses.

History
=======

The SRT used to be part of the SILC Toolkit; a software development kit for
Secure Internet Life Conferencing application programmers.  The SRT was
split off from the SILC Toolkit into its own package due to its generic and
useful nature.  Many APIs still present in SRT have been in use in the SILC
Toolkit since the year 2000.
