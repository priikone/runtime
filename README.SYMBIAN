Compiling SILC Runtime Toolkit for Symbian OS
=============================================

The SRT works on Symbian OS.  This document is intended for those that
want to compile the SRT by themselves for Symbian OS, or for Symbian OS
emulator.  The building environment expects Carbide.c++ and WINSCW compiler
for emulator target and GCCE (variant of GCC) for device target.  The SRT
has not been tested with other compilers or build systems.  The build
environment expects MS Windows.


Requirements
============

- MS Windows
- Carbide.c++ 1.2 or newer


Installing Build Environment
============================

If you do not have a working Carbide.c++ and Symbian OS SDK environment
installed in your MS Windows system it needs to be done first.

1) Download the freely available Carbide.c++ from Nokia at
   http://forum.nokia.com.  The exact hyperlink location changes often, so
   it is not referenced here.  It is usually under "Tools and SDKs" link.

2) After installation a web browser is opened automatically by the
   Carbide.c++ installer.  Follow its instructions by installing the Perl,
   CTags and the SDK.  Perl and the SDK are required, but CTags is
   optional and if necessary can be omitted.

3) The SILC Runtime is generic C and C++ code and should work with any
   SDK.  If you don't have SDK already installed, install the latest
   version you can find.  The links to SDKs are found in the Carbide.c++
   instructions after installation.  If you already have SDK in your
   system, you should use that.

4) After installation the environment should be ready for SRT building.


Building with Carbide.c++
=========================

After starting the Carbide.c++ you will need to import the SRT project.
Go to File -> Import -> Symbian OS -> Symbian OS Bld.inf file, and go
to the extracted SRT source tree and find symbian\bld.inf file and import
it.  When Carbide.c++ asks for the Root Directory, select the root of the
extracted SRT source tree, if not already selected.

After importing the project it is immediately ready for building.  By
default, it will build the following libraries:

	silc.dll		- SILC Core DLL
	silcclient.dll		- SILC Client DLL
	silc.lib		- SILC Core static library
	silcclient.lib		- SILC Client static library

Before building select the target for which you want to build.  Possible
targets are Emulator or Phone with Debug or Release.


Using SILC Runtime in Your Project
==================================

When linking with SRT libraries your application will need to also link
the following Symbian libraries:

	estlib
	euser
	insock
	esock

You will also need to include the \epoc32\include\libc into your system
include path in your project, if not already included.
